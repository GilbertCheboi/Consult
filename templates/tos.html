<h2>16. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
<h3>16.1 Governing Law.</h3>
<p>These Terms of Service and your use of the Call Center&nbsp;Africa Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Kenya applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the Republic of Kenya, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>
<h3>16.2 Binding Arbitration.</h3>
<p>If the parties are unable to resolve a dispute through informal negotiations, the dispute (except those disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the The Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb) and, where appropriate, the CIArb&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("CIArb Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the CIArb website ciarbkenya.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the CIArb Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the CIArb Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either party. The arbitrator must follow applicable Law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable CIArb rules or applicable Law, the arbitration will take place in Nairobi, Kenya. Except as otherwise provided herein, the parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgement on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>If for any reason, a dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the dispute will be commenced or prosecuted in the courts located in Kenya and the parties hereby consent to, and waive all defences of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>In no event will any dispute brought by either party related in any way to the Call Center&nbsp;Africa Service be commenced more than one year after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither party will elect to arbitrate any dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such dispute will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
<p>The parties agree that any arbitration will be limited to the dispute between the parties individually. To the full extent permitted by Law, (a) no arbitration will be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilise class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
<p>The parties agree that the following disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (x) any disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a party; (y) any dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorised use; and (z) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither party will elect to arbitrate any dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such dispute will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
