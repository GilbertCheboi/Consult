YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the The Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb) &nbsp;and, where appropriate, the CIArb&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (&quot;CIArb Consumer Rules&quot;), both of which are available at the CIArb website ciarbkenya.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the CIArb Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the CIArb Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either party. The arbitrator must follow applicable Law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable CIArb rules or applicable Law, the arbitration will take place in Nairobi, Kenya.
